This folder contains all files of results or their processing, organized in the following subfolders:
`data/raw`: your raw data files. These should not be protected against any change after the first storage
`data/processed`: these are files generated by processing the raw data and these are the ones used in the analysis. It can be a copy of the raw data if that is already ready to use. Any processing of the raw data to generate the files here should be documented in the notebook.
`data/metadata`: files containing information about the data that will be useful for future users, readers, and reviewers of your data (e.g. description of variables names, units, and values)
`figures`: figures resulting from the analysis of results.
`tables`: tables resulting from the analysis of results.
