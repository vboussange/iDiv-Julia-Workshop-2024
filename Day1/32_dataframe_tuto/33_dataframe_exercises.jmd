### DataFrames and Plotting with the Iris dataset

Download the "iris.csv" file from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiuc-cse/data-fa14/gh-pages/data/iris.csv). Save it in a file `iris_data.csv`
```julia

```

Load the data from the file into a `DataFrame` called `iris_df`.
```julia

```

Print the entire DataFrame. 
```julia

```

Print only the "species" column of the DataFrame. 
```julia

```


Print the first 5 rows in the DataFrame.
```julia

```

Print only the rows of the `DataFrame` where the "petal_length" is greater than 5. 
```julia

```

Create a new `DataFrame`, which contains the mean and standard deviation of sepal length for each species
```julia

```


Save the DataFrame to a new CSV file called "new_iris.csv".
```julia

```

Provide statistics for the species `setosa`. You should create a new `DataFrame` called `iris_df_setosa` and use the `describe` function.
```julia

```

Create a scatter plot of the `sepal_length` column on the x-axis and the `sepal_width` column on the y-axis. Each species should have a different color.
```julia

```

Add a title to the plot and label the x and y axes. Then, Save the plot to a pdf file using the `savefig()` function.
```julia

```

### Analyzing GBIF dataset using DataFrames, broadcasting, and data visualization

First, let's load GBIF data. Use [GBIF2](https://github.com/rafaqz/GBIF2.jl).
Use the following snippet
```julia
using GBIF2, DataFrames

species_name = "Milvus milvus"
df = occurrence_search(; limit=4000, country=:CH, year=(2000,2020)) |> DataFrame
```


What are the columns of this dataframe? How many rows does it have?
```julia

```

Group occurrences by canton (`stateProvince`). Print all cantons where the birds were observed.
```julia

```

Which canton has the most number of occurrence?
```julia

```

Create a bar chart with `Plots.jl`, that shows the total number of observations for each canton
```julia

```

Drop the rows where the `decimalLongitude` or `decimalLatitude` is `missing`
```julia

```

Normalize the `decimalLongitude` and `decimalLatitude`, so that it scales between 0 and 1.
For this, construct a function `normalize`, that takes in a vector of floating points and a new normalized vector. This function should use the `.` operator.
```julia

```
